  <p> <strong>Raksha Bandhan</strong><br>Here is a **200-word description of Raksha Bandhan**, a beautiful festival celebrated across India:

**Raksha Bandhan – A Festival of Love Between Siblings**

Raksha Bandhan, also known as **Rakhi**, is a popular Indian festival that celebrates the sacred bond between brothers and sisters. It usually falls in **August**, on the full moon day (Purnima) of the **Shravan** month.

On this day, sisters tie a decorative thread called a **rakhi** on their brothers' wrists. This thread is a symbol of love, protection, and lifelong commitment. In return, brothers give gifts and promise to protect their sisters throughout their lives. The ceremony is followed by exchanging sweets and spending quality time together as a family.

Rakhis come in many designs—from simple threads to elaborate, colorful ones. Sisters often perform a small **puja (prayer)**, apply **tilak** on their brothers' foreheads, and offer sweets like **laddoos**, **barfi**, or **pedas**.

Although traditionally celebrated between biological siblings, Raksha Bandhan has now grown to include cousins, friends, and even neighbors. In Maharashtra, the festival is also associated with **Narali Purnima**, when fishermen worship the sea god for safety.

Raksha Bandhan is more than just a ritual; it is a celebration of **family bonds, trust, and emotional support**. It reminds us of the importance of relationships and the joy of caring for each other.
